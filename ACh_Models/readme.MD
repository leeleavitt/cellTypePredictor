For this work i am going to take a couple of approaches.

    1. I am going to use the potassiumDoseResponse as a starting point
    2. Then i am going to include from a variety of experiments, the ACh responses only
        a. What i will then do with the ACh responses is augment them using my 20 degree polynomical aumnetor

Training this data will be a little more complex and tracking success even more so.
The test data will include the original potassiumdoseresponse data. split 50/50 per label. I'll also include ~%30 of the newly added ACh data.

I'll collect ~200 ach responses from this input experiments and then track the sucess of the scores, completely seperate
